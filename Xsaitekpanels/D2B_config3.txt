Fill this file with your indicator assignments!

This is for Xsaitekpanels 2.80

If there is no # sign starting the line it is a comment.
There are two kinds of data reference that can be used.

The first is DATAREF and is one of a kind.

The second is ARRAY and has multiples. An example would be engines which could 
be up to eight. Remember that ARRAY starts with 0 so engine number one is 0.
 
The first eight lines starting with a # match a default 172 annunciator panel
I will describe in detail each line to help in creating your own configurations

This will turn on the top row first indicator red if the first generator is off
#SET BIP A 0 R FROM  ARRAY sim/cockpit2/annunciators/generator_off 0 RANGE 1 TO 1

This will turn on the top row second indicator red if the voltage is low
#SET BIP A 1 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit/warnings/annunciators/low_voltage RANGE 1 TO 1

This will turn on the top row third indicator red if fuel is low
#SET BIP A 2 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/annunciators/fuel_quantity RANGE 1 TO 1

This will turn on the top row fourth indicator red if the parking brake is on
#SET BIP A 3 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/controls/parking_brake_ratio RANGE 1 TO 1

This will turn on the middle row first indicator if oil pressure is low
#SET BIP B 0 R FROM  ARRAY sim/cockpit2/annunciators/oil_pressure_low 0 RANGE 1 TO 1

This will turn on the middle row second indicator if oil temperature in high
#SET BIP B 1 R FROM  ARRAY sim/cockpit2/annunciators/oil_temperature_high 0 RANGE 1 TO 1

This will turn on the middle row third indicator if the vacuum is low
#SET BIP B 2 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/annunciators/low_vacuum RANGE 1 TO 1

This will turn on the middle row fourth indicator if the auto pilot is turned off
#SET BIP B 3 R FROM  DATAREF sim/cockpit2/annunciators/autopilot_disconnect RANGE 1 TO 1

This tests all the indicators when you press the annunciator test button
